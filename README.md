# Fruit Survival (game prototype)

This repo is a simple dump of all files in the Unity project for a game prototype I made.

I have not published a build for this project on my itch.io as it currently contains too many bugs for my liking.

This project is currently on hiatus, as the prototype helped me realize that the game was not as fun as I hoped it would be.
